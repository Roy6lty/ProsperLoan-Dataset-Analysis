Data Analysis


# (Loan Prosper Dataset)
## by (Ayobami Olowoleru)
 
 
## Dataset
 - The data consists of information regarding 113864 Loans with, including LoanYeild, LoanStatus, BorrowAPR and other loan Variables.
 
## Summary of Findings
- In the exploration, I found a significant impact on the Lenderyeild and LP_GrossPriciplalLoss.
- The relations, LenderYeild, had surprisingly increased significantly with the change of the Grading system and is good correlation with BorrowAPR, LP_GrossPrincipalLoss also showed significant reduction when plotted across the rating system.
 
- Negative corelation between at higer Prosperscore gets Lower APR rates, which produces lower yield for the lender.
- Expected relationships were found in the association between the LoanOrignalAmount, and LoanMonthlyPayment. 
- A Positive small correlation was observed between LoanOrignalAmount and LoanMonthlyPayment, but both variables show a negative correlation with LenderYield There was also a small interaction in the categorical Grading System. 
-Borrowers with a high ProsperScore show a negative correlation with LenderYeild, and the reverse is observed for Borrowers with Low ProsperSore.
 
 
 
## Key Insights for Presentation
 
-For the Presentation, I focus on the impact of the PropserRating System on the LenderYeild and
- LP_GrossPricipalLoss variables leave out all the other variables. I start by Introducing the LenderYeild,
followed by the pattern Distribution histogram.
- Next, I will introduce each of the Grading systems plotting them against the LenderYeild and LP_GrossPricipalLoss
using a Boxplot, I am only looking for differences in quartile range between each Grading System.

- Afterward, I would show the magnitude of the difference between each system using a clustered bar chart,
where I will be highlighting the difference between the two systems.
 
- Next, I introduce the Prosperscore and its impact on the Loan Default and Chargeoff rate with  loan status as
a categorical variable
